    <h1>Multiple Pointers Pattern - Open the Console</h1>
    <p>
        Create <strong>pointers</strong> or values that correspond to an index position and move towards the beginning,
        end or middle based on certain conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
        Write a function called <strong>sumZero</strong> which accepts a sorted array of integers. It should find the
        first pair where the sum is 0. Return the array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a
        pair does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]) // [-3, 3]
    </p>
    <p>
        sumZero([-2,0,1,3]) // undefined
    </p>
    <p>To run the code in the console:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            sumZeroNaive(arr)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Uses a nested loop which results in O(n^2) time complexity - time taken to complete task increases
                    exponentially with the number of array elements, n
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            sumZeroRefactor(arr)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Does not use nested loops; has a time complexity of O(n)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uses two pointers, one from the left at index 0 and another from the right at index arr.length - 1. Evaluates the sum and moves the pointer when sum !== 0
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Exercise
    </h3>
    <p>Implement a function called <strong>countUniqueValues</strong>, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it must be sorted.</p>
    <p>countUniqueValues([1,1,1,1,2]) // 2</p>
