    <h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <h4>What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph</li>
        <li>Uses a weighted graph and priority queues (binary heaps)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why is it useful</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>GPS - finding the fastest route</li>
        <li>network routing - finds shortest open path for data</li>
        <li>Biology - used to model spread of viruses</li>
        <li>Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to destination</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Implementing a weighted graph</h3>
    <p>In the adjacencyList i.e. from vertex A: [B, C, D etc.] instead for the weighted graph, need to also store values -> A: [{node: B, weight: 10}, etc.]</p>
    <h4>Class code and addEdge and addVertex method</h4>

    <h3>The Approach</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Everytime a new node is visited, we pick the node with the smallest known distance from the first</li>
        <li>Once moved to that node, we look at each of its neighbours</li>
        <li>For each neighbouring node, we calculate the distance by summing the total edges that lead to the node we're checking from the starting node</li>
        <li>If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance for that node</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Keep track of visited nodes in an array, and keep track of how the shortest distance to a node was reached from the starting node by storing which previous node was used to reach that node.</p>
    <h4>Creating the simple (using array and built in methods) to implement a priority queue</h4>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mlycode/34cf653630951a5514cf4e1f4b3df00a.js"></script>
    <ul>
        <li>This has O(nlogn) time complexity due to using the built in sorting method</li>
        <li>Better to use a binary heap to create a priority queue</li>
        <li>returning the smallest value/priority with dequeue()</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dijkstra's algorithm pseudocode</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Function accepts a starting and ending vertex</li>
        <li>create an object (called distances) and initially sets each key to be every vertex in the graph with a value of infinity, except the starting vertex, which has value (distance from starting vertex) of 0</li>
        <li>after setting the values in the distance object, add each vertex with a priority of infinity to the priority queue, except the starting vertex, which has priority 0 (it is where we begin)</li>
        <li>create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacencyList, starting value of null for all</li>
        <li>start looping as long as there is something in the priority queue</li>
        <ul>
            <li>dequeue a vertex from the priority queue</li>
            <li>if that vertex is === ending vertex, return (done)</li>
            <li>else, loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex</li>
            <ul>
                <li>calculate the distance to that vertex from the starting vertex</li>
                <li>if the distance is less than what is currently stored in the distances object</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>update the distances object with a new lower distance</li>
                    <li>update the previous object to contain that vertex</li>
                    <li>enqueue the vertex with the total distance from the start node</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
