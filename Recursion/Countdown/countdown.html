    <h1>Countdown Recursive Code</h1>
    <h3>
        Recursive Code
    </h3>
    <p>
        Definition: Code which executes itself. Continuosly pushes functions onto the call stack to be executed until the <strong>Base Case</strong> is reached. Each time the recursive code is called, a different input is used.
    </p>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>run countDown(num) in the console</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Uses recursive code and not a loop (countDownLoop(num) uses a loop)
        </li>
        <li>
            countDown(num) calls itself continuously until it reaches a defined base condition (if (num <=0) return)
        </li>
    </ul>
