    <h1>
        Selection Sorting Algorithm
    </h1>
    <p>
        Places the smallest value into the sorted position one at a time. It goes through the data set to find the minimum and swap it to the start.
    </p>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>Run selectionSort(arr) in the console to sort an array of numbers</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Nested loop which keeps a track of the index of the minimum value to then be swapped
        </li>
        <li>
            Has an O(n^2) time complexity because of the nested loop
        </li>
    </ul>
