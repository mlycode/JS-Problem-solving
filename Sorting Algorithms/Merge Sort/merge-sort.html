    <h1>Merge Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <h3>Merge, Quick and Radix Sort?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort don't scale well (take longer for larger arrays) - These have quadratic time complexity
        </li>
        <li>
            Merge, Quick and Radix Sort improve the time complexity to O(nlogn), which is better than quadratic
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Merge Sort</h3>
    <p>Overview:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A combination of merging and sorting</li>
        <li>Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted</li>
        <li>Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a sorted array by merging the smaller arrays in sorted order</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The single element arrays are sorted, making merging the sorted arrays easier than an unsorted array</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>Run mergeSort([array of unsorted values]) in the console</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses recursive code that splits the array into single element arrays before merging the arrays in sorted order</li>
        <li>
            Has O(n) Space Complexity
        </li>
        <li>
            Has O(nlogn) Time complexity
            <ul>
                <li>
                    O(logn) from splitting the array (number of decompositions), O(n) from comparing with the merge function resulting in O(nlogn)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
