    <h1>Quick Sort Algorithm</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Also exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted</li>
        <li>Selects one element (called the pivot) and finds the index where the pivot should end up (everything lower than pivot moves to the left...)</li>
        <li>Quick sort then applied on either side of the pivot (once the pivot is positioned correctly)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <p>Run quickSort([arr]) in the console to sort an array of numbers</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Code picks the first element in the array and compares it to the other elements. Each time an element is smaller than the pivot, a pivotIndex variable is incremented, and the pivotIndex value is swapped with the current value (in the loop). Each loop returns the pivotIndex
        </li>
        <li>
            The pivot swap code is executed recursively until the element size reaches 1, which finally returns the sorted array
        </li>
        <li>
            Best and worst case time complexity is O(nlogn) due to logn decompositions of the initial array. Again, O(n) comes from the n amount of comparisons (like merge sort)
        </li>
        <li>
            The worst case (taking the first element in the array) has O(n^2) time complexity. An already sorted array results in O(n) decompositions and O(n) comparisons. Occurs because of pivoting at the first array element. Can be improved by picking a random or middle element.
        </li>
    </ul>
